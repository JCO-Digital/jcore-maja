# Composer
Composer is a package manager for PHP packages, and can be used to install WP plugins as well as libraries needed for JCOREÂ®. Composer is used in different degrees in different projects. Sometimes it is only used to install Timber and ACF, and sometimes to manage all plugins in the project.

```
These three packages are used for setting up [WordPress Coding Standards for PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards) in the project.

## Languages and tranlations

JCOre adds loco translate locally, and the theme/languages -folder contians a jcore.pot -file. The projects "small words" are translated for ex on a Swedish site in development, and the plugin should not be added to composer. Translations are pushed with the project.

``` json
"wpackagist-plugin/loco-translate":
```

-Only move to require from require-dev in composer if the CUSTOMER him/herself needs access and does translations themselves. -Then locotranslate needs to be added to composer, activated and a CUSTOM translation added on live, for it not to be overwritten by push.
